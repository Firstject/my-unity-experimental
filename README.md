# Roll A TROLLING FACE
Roll A TROLLING FACE is a side-view platformer game which features comedy trolling environments similar to [Trap Adventure 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_Adventure_2). This game is based on a Unity Learn project called ["Roll a Ball"](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball).
